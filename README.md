# Hey, I’m Andrea (itsarodav) 👋

Product Designer + Design Engineer. I design, build, iterate… and somehow end up shipping. On loop. 🔁

## 🧰 Tools
Figma · Tailwind · SCSS · Angular · TypeScript · Storybook · Ableton 🎛️

## 🥁 Current setlist
- Prelude DS Icons (SVG icons engineered for UI)
- Ven a Valencia (responsive, semantic HTML/SCSS)
- Exploring automation + AI workflows to keep shipping faster (Codex, Claude, etc).

## 🚧 What’s next
- **Prelude DS** - tokens, components and docs (the whole orchestra)
- **Linkims** - a small project to show and connect!

## ✨ Grounded workflow
AI for speed. Human judgment for quality and scalability.
